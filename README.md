# Impact of Global Economy due to COVID-19

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the global economy, affecting individuals, businesses, and entire industries worldwide. Lockdowns, travel restrictions, and government-imposed measures have disrupted global supply chains, decreased consumer spending, and led to significant job losses. This project explores the economic repercussions of COVID-19 on different countries and examines the factors most correlated with pandemic severity. Our objective is to gain insights into how the pandemic affected various economic indicators across regions.

### Key Questions
1. Which countries were most impacted economically by COVID-19, and how did this relate to tourism, cases, and death rates?
2. What are the strongest correlations between economic factors (e.g., GDP, unemployment) and COVID-19 case and death rates?
3. How can visualization techniques be used to effectively communicate economic trends and insights?

## Motivation
The pandemic has highlighted the interconnectedness of global economies and the vulnerabilities within. Understanding how COVID-19 has impacted different economies can guide future policymaking and preparedness. By exploring economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment, and inflation, we aim to provide insights that could benefit policymakers, researchers, and the general public.

   - **Timeline:** January 2020 - January 2021
   - **Variables:** Country/region, date, confirmed cases, deaths, etc.
   - **Entries:** 2,247,228
   - **Purpose:** To study the spread of COVID-19 across different countries and its correlation with economic metrics.

## Analysis & Visualizations
### Bubble Chart
- **Variables:** Percentage of GDP, Total COVID-19 Cases (based on country)
- **Goal:** To visualize how COVID-19 cases impacted different countries' GDP and assess the correlation with economic activity, particularly tourism.

### Bar Chart
- **Variables:** Unemployment Rate, Total COVID-19 Cases (based on country)
- **Goal:** To examine the unemployment rate's relation to COVID-19 cases, shedding light on how the pandemic affected labor markets.

### Map Visualization
- **Variables:** Total COVID-19 Cases, GDP, GDP per capita (based on country)
- **Goal:** To map out the relationship between COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita, highlighting the economic resilience of different regions.

### Line Graph
- **Variables:** Total COVID-19 Cases, Monthly Income (based on country)
- **Goal:** To demonstrate the effect of COVID-19 on monthly incomes, using case data to show the income impact over time.

### Table
- **Insight:** Lists countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- **Observation:** The progression of COVID-19 cases over quarters, with a spike in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.

### Pie Chart
- **Variables:** Country, Year, Inflation Rate (based on World Bank data)
- **Goal:** To compare inflation rates across countries in relation to annual income, showing the impact on purchasing power during the pandemic.

## Key Variables
- **COVID-19 Cases and Deaths:** Absolute numbers and per capita rates for each country.
- **Economic Indicators:** GDP, unemployment rate, inflation rate, and others, measured in percentages or rates.

## Limitations
- **Temporal Coverage:** Data spans up to early 2021 for COVID-19 cases and 2020 for economic data, limiting insights on post-2021 impacts.
- **Data Gaps:** Inconsistencies and gaps in data reporting across countries may introduce biases.
- **Indicator Scope:** Some economic indicators are limited in terms of granularity or regional representation.

## Key Findings
- The economic impact of COVID-19 varied greatly by country, with some nations experiencing minor disruptions and others facing severe recessions.
- There is a notable correlation between high COVID-19 cases/deaths and weaker economies, suggesting that the pandemic hit vulnerable economies harder.
- Economic indicators like GDP and unemployment were significantly affected in most regions, with certain industries (e.g., tourism) taking a larger hit.

## Concepts Demonstrated
This project showcases multiple concepts, including:
- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Preparing datasets for analysis and handling missing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using statistical and visual tools to explore relationships between COVID-19 and economic indicators.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visual aids to convey patterns, including bubble charts, bar charts, and choropleth maps.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Drawing comparisons between countries to provide a nuanced view of the pandemic's impact on the global economy.
